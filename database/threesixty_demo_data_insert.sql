	'In support of our community engagement efforts in connection with the Health Matters IZI, Marnitas Table brought in Latinx outreach specialist, Blanca Martinez Gavina to connect with hard-to-reach immigrant stakeholders. Her one-on-one outreach efforts included Scott County Public Schools, local churches, apartment complexes, Latinx restaurants and other businesses where she had direct contact 
with approximately 250 Latinx individuals. She reported two prominent themes while in conversation with local community, as detailed below.

**Fear of being out in the community**: Gavina found in her outreach that an estimated 40%-50% of the people she spoke with expressed that they felt afraid when they were out in the community. Both undocumented and documented Latinxs said that they preferred to stay home and not go outside. 

When asked why, many stated that they experienced police profiling and that they felt that members of the "mainstream" community did not want them there. Many felt there was a link between local police and immigration enforcement.

One woman reported that she had an experience where ICE (Immigration Customs Enforcement) had held her outside of her apartment. She had begged them not to enter the apartment without her as her six-year-old was inside alone and would be terrified by their presence. The agent disregarded her plea and almost knocked down the apartment door to find the daughter hiding in the bathroom. Both were taken into custody, but were released within a week. The mother explained that to this day (4 years later) her daughter suffers from PTSD and something as simple as someone knocking on the door sends her daughter into a traumatic state. She reported that neither have received any mental health support. Nor has she been given an explanation for their detainment. She stated that they barely go out and stay at home most of the time due to fear since that experience.

Another individual stated that police monitor and racially profile Latinx (and other communities of color) on Marshall Street near the highly Latinx populated apartment complexes. They stated that even teenagers and children are often stopped and harassed without cause and that many community members avoid going outside as they often see two or three police patrols around their neighborhood.

Our outreach also found that this fear even impacts the healthcare access of U.S. citizens — including children and other relatives of undocumented people. Despite having access to insurance, parents are afraid to sign up and have their names and addresses on record.
**Lack of insurance and access to health services**: An estimated 40-60% of the Latinx individuals she spoke with mentioned that they did not have health insurance or alternately, that someone in their family did not have access to any type of healthcare. She found that the majority of the people she had contact with stated that they had never been approached about or seen any information regarding healthcare services offered in Scott County.

**Examples**:
- A 59-year-old woman reported she did not have health insurance for over a year. She had to buy her medication at full price out-of-pocket and sometimes skips taking it due to the expense. She reported that she was directed to go to St. Paul when she inquired at a local service agency (unnamed). Due to a lack of transportation she has not been able to go and obtain insurance.
- A 70-year-old woman reported that she has not had health insurance for the past five years. She was diagnosed with diabetes yet she does not get medical treatment to manage it because of the expense. This individual stated that she takes home remedies to "feel better."
- A 45-year-old woman reported that she had to travel out of state to get a life-saving surgery that kept her away from her family for a month. Despite having some health insurance, she reported that she could not afford the expense to have the surgery in Minnesota.
- A 60-year-old man stopped going to his follow-up appointments because he was told by a medical professional that local hospitals were sharing patient information with ICE.

Blanca estimates that more than half of the people she contacted stated that their one-on-one interview with her was the first time anyone had approached them about healthcare access. Many individuals shared that the community is only receiving care when there are emergency situations, and that they are not able to access preventative services.

We do not intend the sharing of these findings as an indictment of the outreach work of Public Health or the other agencies involved in the Health Care Collaborative. We merely want to bring to light that there are pockets of vulnerable people in the community who are not aware of the resources that might be available to them or who are at present unable or unwilling to access those resources due to the current climate of fear caused by anti-Latinx rhetoric and policies. We hope that the good relationships catalyzed during the IZI will create pathways into these pockets and begin to build trust in the local healthcare systems.',
	'We feel strongly that this initial event has created a great opportunity to strengthen relationships between underserved community members and healthcare organizations in the county. In order to reap the full benefits of Intentional Social Interaction, it is important to trust the process. Every detail is intentional (hence the name!) and so when we provide critical feedback on central issues, it is because we do not want deviations from the model to detract from our overall project and collaborator goals. Our model has been refined and proven through the experience of bringing over 40,000 individuals together across difference for over 10 years, and while we always aim to exceed the goals of our clients and collaborative partners, that can only happen when we stay true to all twenty touchpoints of the 
model.

With this in mind, we have outlined below some of our findings and recommendations to improve future collaboration and fidelity to the model:
- Resist focusing too heavily on the RSVP lists. In IZI, we collect RSVPs only, I) to get a sense of the numbers of people who will be in attendance for ordering food, and 2) to get a sense of which communities we might need to put extra attention into intentionally inviting to ensure a good mix of people in the room.
- Do not release information about other events on the day of the event. During the afternoon of the event, our outreach specialist Blanca was inundated with frantic calls from members of the community who were concerned they could not attend because they were told they had to "register." We later found out that there was information released about an additional event being held by Public Health and that was what caused the confusion. Due to the number of people who initially reported they were attending from the Latinx community being much higher than the number that actually attended, we believe this may have negatively impacted attendance.

The power of IZI is in moving from the transactional to the transformational. When one attempts to insert more transactional approaches into the process, the momentum is lost. Circle Share-in is designed to allow people leaving the event to feel inspired and changed, and represents the final ritual moment of the night. People feel it in their bodies. In order to maximize the impact of Circle Share-in we recommend that hosts:

- Avoid ending with announcements of future events. If there is a desire to recruit for future events, have each collaborative and/or staff member agree to invite at least three people one-on-one and intentionally bring them into the conversation. You could also create a Sticky Stat on the upcoming events and have the question answered in the Lightning Rounds activity to bring it to everyones attention in the room.
- We also do not recommend promising another "event like this" as people will expect something exactly like IZI. If you do not have the training to execute all twenty touchpoints, or the support of our team, it is unlikely to have the same feel and impact as an IZI. Participants will also anticipate that there will be ample food, a place for children and cross-cultural communication supports, and if these expectations are not met, this may negatively impact your capacity to bring people into conversation in the future!

Based on the community feedback shared during the outreach and engagement processes, it is clear that deepening trust and increasing community engagement is an important sector for the ongoing efforts of the collaborative. Deepening connection came up in response to several of the questions in Mindstorm and across many of the conversation groups, both the need for healthcare providers and organizations to deepen their relationships with their clients and underserved communities as well as the need for the community as a whole to have spaces and opportunities to connect with one another for their health and wellbeing. This desire to connect was indicated both within cultural and other affinity groups but also across difference and among community broadly.

We recommend:
- Continuing to create opportunities to meet with the community on their terms. This means outside of the regular workday hours, on evenings and weekends, in community locations with ample food and spaces for children and families to fully participate.
- Interpretation is important in cross-cultural conversations but immigrant communities would also like to talk about their health and wellbeing in their first languages, so culturally-specific conversations were also requested so that cultural communities can focus on their unique needs and situations as well.
- Inviting works best when it is initiated peer-to-peer. Electronic communication only reaches a select few and written materials are helpful, but only when used in collaboration with direct contact and encouragement.

We have truly valued the experience of partnering on this event with the Scott County Health Care Collaborative and would be happy to deepen the work in the future to further the impact. It was wonderful to witness the deepening of relationships and bridging social capital that occurred in the room and to see how well-received the experience of authentic welcome was for so many diverse members of the county. It is our hope that this event met the needs and goals of the Collaborative as a whole and of each individual member who went through the process with us. We believe that any of the procedural adjustments covered in this report might easily be smoothed out in the future, as you have now experienced the process with first-hand knowledge and understanding of the tools and methodology we use to engage community for meaningful, sustainable impact.'

	'On Tuesday, September 18th 2018, approximately 121 community members and representatives of organizations and programs with a vested interest in preventing diseases of despair were brought together at the Lake Calhoun Event Center (St. Mary’s Greek Orthodox Church) in Minneapolis for a feast and engaged conversation and collaborative planning session on primary prevention and holistic and integrative strategies for preventing diseases of despair including suicide, alcoholism and other chemical dependency disorders. The all-day unConference was divided into morning sessions, focusing on “Naming the Issue,” an afternoon luncheon Mindstorm (focused discussion) section designed to support participants in “Making the Connections” necessary to produce systemic and intra-systemic change, and afternoon strategic planning activities geared toward “Catalyzing Action.”

The event featured pop-up testimonial presentations providing a wide range of lenses highlighting community impacts of despair and its associated diseases, including perspectives from Assistant Commissioner of the Minnesota Department of Health, Jeanne Ayers, Paul Riedner of the Veteran Resilience Project, Dr. Helen Kim of the Hennepin County Medical Center, Senior Vice President of Community Impact for the Minnesota Foundation, Chanda Smith Baker, and Donna LaChapelle of the Indian Women’s Resource Center and the Center for Mind-Body Medicine. Participants who wished to weigh in with their own brief observations and relevant stories and data were invited and encouraged to participate in open-mic style pop up sharing opportunities interwoven throughout the day. Facilitator Marnita Schroedl led several “mindful moment break-ins” including a minute of gratitude and a physical activity for releasing tension, in addition to guiding participants through the afternoon’s collaborative planning session.

Breakfast, desserts and a luncheon feast appropriate for all dietary needs from vegan to carnivore were prepared by Fabulous Catering. In addition, a Quiet Room staffed by local practitioners Ayo Clemons, Rowan Fakhoury, and Awana Moye was also made available to all guests.', 

	'This luncheon Mindstorm was undertaken on Tuesday, September 18th by guests of the 2018 unConference Building Resilience: Preventing Diseases of Despair. For this set of small group discussions, we asked participants to focus their conversations on the questions from the Mindstorm discussion guide (see facsimile on page 3) that their luncheon discussion group thought most important to address. Nine groups of participants submitted notes from the Mindstorm discussions. Identical instructions were given to each group on how to conduct their discussions and submit notes after the session. 

Although participants were given the option to rank the discussion topic questions in descending order of their estimation of each topic’s importance, only two groups elected to rank questions, one of which submitted incomplete ranking information. This limits the interpretability and utility of a rankings analysis in this report, however, we have included the submitted ranking votes in the instructions sheet facsimile for your information (see page 3).

The following is an overview and analysis of the emergent themes resulting from these conversations, as recorded by participant scribes on the notes sheet included with the questions. The handwritten responses have been transcribed, aggregated and de-identified in a document following this analysis. 

Central themes emerging from the discussion notes include the importance of being able to meet basic needs, the centrality of social connections as a preventative measure and safety net for those suffering in silence, and a variety of proposed approaches to combatting the issue from the perspectives of the individual, the family, the community, public policy and public and private systems or agencies.'

It’s important to listen to stories and realize that everyone is in some kind of pain. We talked about that cultural connection. I also talked to Paul and thanked him for his service. My niece was also in Iraq, so I know how important it is to listen to those stories. Choose kindness versus being strong. I heard someone say humility. You have to be fully human.

I’ve been working in health and wellness and suicide prevention for a decade, we’ve been trying to cure heart disease and thinking about mental health and wellness and suicide prevention. How do people get to this place of despair? We think prevention is about creating community and preventing social isolation. Every teen I’ve talked to about suicide has talked about isolation, saying I just wish someone were there, I wish someone cared, with no shame or blame. As a community, I think we lack that – safe places where people can say I’m struggling with alcohol and I need help. It’s about creating community and a sense of belonging. We live in the Wright County, in a town called Casado – and in the last year, in this small town, it [suicide] has occurred eight times. These weren’t people with a history of mental health issues, nobody in our community knew – one of these people was a member of my family. My mission today is to say, you know, if you need someone to talk to who won’t look at you like a weirdo, just listen – creating that environment.'

We get caught up in systems and perpetuate behaviors and policies without taking the time to step back and see what’s working, which leads to families and individuals suffering from the same things over and over because systems haven’t taken a step back to look at what people actually need. Housing is another one – we’re having an affordable housing crisis in Minneapolis. I’m sure many of you know about the encampment here in Minneapolis. The systems are going in and talking to those folks to find out what they need, so that’s something we can do to better meet the needs of individuals and clients we serve.'

We talked about increasing capacity to learn how to find ways to survive and thrive through means of healing that are more appropriate. A power shift is essential; US culture needs healing from trauma. Everyone has work to do in our own communities and across communities as well. Camille made a distinction between changing behavior and changing hearts and minds. Changing behaviors is the way to go, but you have to want to change.

The idea that some of us expressed significant chronic and mental health issues, so self-care comes in. I find that in times of stress or trauma my self-care gets better. I had the privilege of safety and support and love from such an early age that those self-care practices were already engrained, so it makes you grateful, since not everyone has access to that care, to housing and food security.

Doctors don’t make the best patients or necessarily engage in self-care even though there is a lot of exposure to trauma.  Someone mentioned that historical trauma exists in the bodies and minds of the oppressed, but also within the oppressor.

There’s someone here who was diagnosed with cancer and who felt insecure about being treated here, so she went back to her home town in Kenya for treatment and to be around family and community, homecooked meals – then she was able to fight it when we came home. So, food, culture, connection. We talked about how we have different ethnicities, local food, spices – like lemongrass in SE Asian cuisine. It can be both food and tea – education is important to empower every individual to get well and to improve health disparities regardless of wealth. I’ll add about spirituality and the traditional practices of spirituality in community, specifically the Hmong community’s practice of Shamanism. After war and displacement all over the world there has been a break in the traditional practice of shamanism and cultural healing – there’s a generational gap there.

That you are where you are at this present moment because of your actions in the past. Which empowers you to be responsible for your actions. That’s why as Hindus we accept suffering in our lives, but also know that by making different choices we can make a difference in the future. So, I bring that aspect to my work with inner city children and in the workshops I teach. So today might be a blank page you have and you can design it according to what future you want – knowing that our present life is determined by our past – what choices we make today will be the past of tomorrow. Start creating a new past that you have power over (unlike the belief system and experiences you had in the first eight years of life or so). Self-awareness, yoga and meditation is part of our lifestyle. It’s not something you keep separate. It’s your values, who you are, your family unit. It’s very common to have joint families (in my culture). It’s happening now slowly in this country because of economics – so that’s the other way around. But with self-awareness, once we know where we are coming from, we know that your internal words become the world of the kids coming behind us, the future. The future is a promissory note, but the present is a gift. Knowing that this moment too shall pass, anything in the moment you can handle. Take back the power and you can make your life what you want.'

In the notes, participants explored a range of definitions and approaches to addressing despair and working towards primary prevention, with a special eye toward issues of equity and trauma-informed responses (“recognizing the role of white supremacy and capitalism”), public education and norms development (“educate adults and children at [the] same time,” and “normalize the symptoms and the response to dysfunctional situations”), the implementation of holistic care policies by doctors and systems (such as narrative medicine, recommended by one group urging medical providers to “train doctors to listen for human stories, not just symptoms”), and emphasizing the “human-to-human” connection and extra-clinical preventative measures. Participants also highlighted a need for secondary trauma resources for those who work with issues of despair, trauma and trauma-related care and spoke to the idea that “prevention might not happen in a clinical setting,” again drawing attention to social connections and inter-systemic models of preventative care, ultimately a standout theme in this Mindstorm.'

Guests opined that “people need to feel welcome where they live…not isolated,” and urged those interested in resilience and primary prevention of suicide, alcoholism and other diseases of despair to “listen to stories ➔ everyone is in pain,” highlighting the hidden-in-plain-sight nature of isolation, alienation, and despair, alongside possibilities for increasing and deepening social connections as a critical strategy for addressing these issues.'

	'
* INSPIRED: I’m planning to follow through with people in this room to see how we can shift systems.
* ENERGIZED: I will connect with people I met here today who are outside of my world.
* REJUVENATION: I’ve had to take a break from working in Human Services, but today has inspired me to pick up where I left off.
* INSPIRED: Give people space to tell their story.
* PLAYFUL: Inspired to keep showing up as a vulnerable and playful leader.
* GRATEFUL/OVERWHELMED: Continue working for change.
* ABUNDANT: I want to take this example of abundance to a group I work with in NW MN on reducing alcohol and substance abuse.
* REMINDED: Start by following up on all of the business cards I got today.
* EXPANDED: Work with a mindfulness practitioner to bring that practice to the homeless community.
* INSPIRED: Do what is good and what is life-affirming.
* EDUCATED (ABOUT BEYONCE): It was good to get out of my own little world to see other perspectives on what I do. I’ll take this back to my students and share with them what I learned today, as well as to my research.
* INSPIRED: Take what happened to my workplace and see what we can do.
* INSPIRED: More peer support!

* CONNECTED: Build on community connections that exist and take new action.

* APPRECIATION: I will be responsive to the people who asked to talk more to me or get stuff from me and continue to work to advanced systems change.

* CHALLENGED: My opinions have been challenged about nine medical ways people can be happier and healthier.
* "GRUNTLED": I often think the opposite of hopelessness isn’t hope, it’s certainty. I need to take the action of doing nothing as a form of self-care, just being and having a calm way of connecting to get to the work I do in the 12-step arena and medical marijuana.
* HOPEFUL: I came in not knowing what to expect being military myself, I am familiar with resilience and I love social justice – so thank you to everyone here.

* ENLIGHTENED THROUGH CONVERSATIONS WITH PEOPLE OF DIFFERENT CULTURES AND BACKGROUNDS: Encouraged to make connections with people who can help with our work.
* POSITIVE: Knowing that we’re all working toward a positive outcome, I feel positive.
* SAFE: I feel safe to take the time to hear stories, to take time for self-care, to acknowledge the trauma that until today I didn’t realize brought me here; safe because I found a community – every person I talked to, their hearts are so much bigger than I could have guessed; safe, moving into the future, knowing that you’re there.
* GRATEFUL: My heart is so full, I escaped the stress in the office today.
* GRATEFUL: It’s unique to have everyone show up authentically and speak your truth – it doesn’t often happen in a professional context. Also contemplate about how to embed this in my work.
* CONTEMPLATIVE: To think about how to embed this work in the opportunities I have to influence things.
* CONNECTEDNESS: When community shows up, cares for one another and maximizes that connection – that’s healthy power.
* COMMUNITY: I haven’t been feeling very connected, but this is a space where I’ve been feeling connected to community.
* POTENT: There’s so much potency here in this room, it’s juicy; there’s this amazing potential that we are on the cusp of change, and this must change. We are all making this change together – I’m going to take all the things we’re collecting here today, turn it into a beautiful report and send that information back to you.
